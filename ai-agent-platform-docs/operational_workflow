🧭 AI Agent Platform – Operational Workflow Guide

Last updated: November 2025

This document explains how to operate your multi-agent system in ChatGPT (GPT-5 Pro Plan).
It covers when to talk to the Project Manager Agent versus the specialist agents, and the correct daily workflow for running and logging work.

⸻

1. Overview of Team Roles

Project Manager Agent (PM Agent)
	•	Central coordinator.
	•	Maintains priorities, tracks health, merges updates, manages TODO, CHANGELOG, and master project file.
	•	Always your starting point for daily planning, progress review, task assignment, and coordination.

Architect Agent
	•	Oversees structure, dependencies, and repo organization.
	•	Handles architecture decisions, folder/file structure, backend ↔ frontend consistency.

Frontend Agent
	•	Handles user interface and visual logic (Next.js, Tailwind, components).
	•	Responsible for UI issues, design changes, React/Next component fixes.

Backend Agent
	•	Handles server logic, API routes, Supabase schema, integrations.
	•	Responsible for database logic, API endpoints, Supabase functions.

Workflow Agent
	•	Manages automations and external integrations (Activepieces, Make.com).
	•	Used for automations, event triggers, API bridges.

LLM Trainer Agent
	•	Manages fine-tuning and data prep for OpenAI models.
	•	Handles model training or prompt data updates.

Avatar & Voice Agent
	•	Handles voice/visual assets, TTS/STT, avatars, and media.
	•	Responsible for audio, voice cloning, avatars, animations.

2. Where to Start Each Day
	1.	Run automation scripts:

./automation/update_memory.sh  
./automation/sync_docs_to_github.sh

This ensures all docs are current and backed up.

	2.	Open the Project Manager Agent chat and send:

/update_master  
Here’s the current snapshot.  
(Paste or link 00_MASTER_PROJECT.md, TODO.md, CHANGELOG.md)


	3.	Review the Daily Plan that the PM Agent outputs.
Approve or adjust the plan and decide which tasks you’ll handle personally or delegate to the other agents.

3. How Workflows Are Structured

Communication Hierarchy

You  ⇄  Project Manager Agent  ⇄  Specialist Agents

	•	You tell the PM Agent what needs to happen (feature, bug fix, idea).
	•	The PM Agent decides which specialist agent is responsible.
	•	You then hand off that task to the agent using the PM’s summary or by directly pasting the relevant request.
	•	This keeps the PM Agent as the single source of truth.

Typical Task Flow Example

Scenario: You want to fix the onboarding question flow for new AI agent creation.
	1.	You → PM Agent:
“We need to refine the question flow during agent creation.”
	2.	PM Agent → You:
It replies:
“This involves Frontend and Backend. Please handoff to Frontend first for UI flow, then Backend for validation logic.”
	3.	You → Frontend Agent:
Paste the PM’s summary:

/handoff Frontend Agent – update the question flow UI as described by PM Agent.  
Here’s the current issue...


	4.	Frontend Agent:
Writes or revises code.
You test it locally.
When done, ask it:

/summarize_session Summarize what was done today.


	5.	You → PM Agent:
“Frontend completed the question flow update. Here’s the summary.”
The PM Agent logs it, updates TODO and CHANGELOG, and confirms overall status.
	6.	End of Day:
Run update_memory.sh and sync_docs_to_github.sh.

4. When to Talk to Each Agent

Project Manager Agent
	•	Planning new work
	•	Reviewing progress
	•	Coordination between agents
	•	Summaries and reporting

Architect Agent
	•	Architecture or folder structure decisions
	•	Repo organization, dependencies, or code standards

Frontend Agent
	•	UI bugs, design tweaks, React component logic

Backend Agent
	•	API routes, Supabase schema, backend logic

Workflow Agent
	•	Automations and Make.com/Activepieces workflows

LLM Trainer Agent
	•	Fine-tuning, model data prep, or prompt optimization

Avatar & Voice Agent
	•	Audio, avatars, and voice integrations

If unsure who to contact — always start with the Project Manager Agent.

5. Logging and Continuity
	•	Every activation or session summary from agents gets pasted into its context file.
	•	The Project Manager Agent merges those logs into 00_MASTER_PROJECT.md.
	•	update_memory.sh and sync_docs_to_github.sh preserve backups automatically.

At the end of each day:
	1.	Check off your Daily Checklist.
	2.	Run both automation scripts.
	3.	Ask the PM Agent to /summarize_session — it will output a daily project summary.

⸻

6. Rules of Thumb
	•	Always start with the PM Agent. Keeps the master docs aligned.
	•	Specialists never coordinate directly without PM. Prevents data drift.
	•	After each work session, summarize. Keeps logs consistent.
	•	At the end of the day, run automations. Updates backups and GitHub.
	•	If in doubt, ask the PM Agent. It’s your control tower.

7. Daily Loop Summary

Morning:
   → Run automations
   → PM Agent gives plan

During the day:
   → Work with assigned specialist agents
   → Test and confirm changes
   → Send results back to PM Agent

End of day:
   → Run automations again
   → PM Agent summarizes progress
   → Complete Daily Checklist


⸻

8. In Practice
	•	You manage what gets done.
	•	Project Manager Agent manages who does it and records it.
	•	Specialist Agents handle how it gets done (code, troubleshooting, or design).
	•	Automations keep all files and GitHub perfectly in sync.
