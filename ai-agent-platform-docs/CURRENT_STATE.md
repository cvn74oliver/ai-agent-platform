# 🟢 System Health

Build: Clean  
Golden Path: Passing  
Agents: Healthy  
Documentation: Synced  

Recalculate Quality:
- Fast path enabled (no rewrite if score ≥ TARGET_QUALITY_SCORE = 8)
- Rewrite gating verified (no unnecessary OpenAI refine calls)
- Force Full Rewrite available
- Dry Run supported (no persistence)
- Strict JSON schema enforced
- Circuit breaker active for OpenAI aborts
- Rewrite retry guarded against under-detailed outputs
- Canonical merge protection (no silent field shrink)

RAG Retrieval:
- Embedding + cosine similarity active
- URL boost logic (context-aware)
- Drive-first weighting for book-content queries
- Product-page penalty for non-shopping intent
- Canonical hierarchy enforced:
  Q&A training data > Drive knowledge > Crawled URLs
- Drive chunk retrieval validated against real PDF previews (875 embedded chunks confirmed active)

RAG Sync:
- Delta + Full modes implemented
- Wildcard detection supported
- Job-based ingestion (rag_jobs)
- Supabase polling status updates
- Manual worker trigger retained for dev

Drive ingestion verified:
- 875 embedded Drive chunks
- 541 embedded URL chunks
- Avg chunk size ≈ 1400–1500 chars
- Retrieval validation confirmed via Playground

Dashboard Metrics:
- Session logging (agent_sessions)
- Event logging (agent_events)
- Token usage tracking
- Approx cost + human-time proxy

- Usage metrics captured

## LLM Training
- Save & Next
- Save & Finish
- Evidence pack integration
- Non-destructive prompt merge
- Quality score persistence
- fine_tune_examples logging

## Backend Stability
- evaluateQuality stable
- finalRefine stable
- Strict JSON schemas enforced
- Evidence compaction active
- Embedding normalization hardened
- Cosine similarity retrieval validated
- Core contract fields protected from shrink (>30%)
- Strict merge preservation validated during forced rewrite (no contract loss observed)

# 🚀 Current Strategic Focus

Phase 3 — Controlled Expansion

1. RAG → Prompt Rewrite Integration
   - Drive knowledge influences rewrites
   - Q&A contract remains canonical
   - RAG used as evidence layer, not override

2. Fine-Tune Alignment
   - Drive = knowledge base
   - Q&A = behavioral authority
   - Separation of knowledge vs behavior weighting maintained

3. Project Manager v7 Transition
   - Finalize logs
   - Snapshot v6 state
   - Activate v7 under Codex execution protocol

# 🧪 Golden Path (Must Always Pass)

1. Next training suggestion works.
2. Save & Next works.
3. Save & Finish triggers rewrite.
4. Preview shows canonical grouping.
5. Quality score updates correctly.
6. RAG Sync schedules job.
7. RAG Worker processes documents.
8. Playground retrieves correct Drive content.
9. Usage logging records activity.

If any fail → immediate fix.

# ⚠ Acceptable Limitations

- Wildcard domains require discovery scans.
- No precise progress % (document-count proxy used).
- Worker is single-process (no distributed queue yet).
- OpenAI timeouts possible under heavy refine (guarded).

---

# 🧠 Strategic Position

The system is out of debugging mode and in stabilized infrastructure state.

Operational pillars:
- Prompt Engineering Loop
- RAG Retrieval Engine
- Training Canonicalization
- Job-Based Knowledge Sync
- Usage Analytics Foundation

v6 stabilized.  
Platform ready for v7 activation.

# 🔒 v6 Snapshot Freeze
This file represents the final stabilized state before Project Manager v7 activation.
No further structural edits should occur under v6.
