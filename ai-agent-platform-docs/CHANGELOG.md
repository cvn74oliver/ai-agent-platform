### 🧩 November 8, 2025 – New Agent Activation

**Prompt Engineer Agent (v1) Created and Activated**

- Added 08_PROMPT_ENGINEER_CONTEXT.md to `/web/docs/`.
- Registered activation prompts inside `agent_activation_checklist.md`.
- Appended to Agent Session Health list in `TODO.md`.
- Generated top 5 launch priorities and initial daily plan.
- All agents verified healthy via `/health_check` (8 total active).
- System synchronization performed post-activation (update_memory + sync_docs_to_github).

Outcome:
The Prompt Engineer Agent now manages all prompt design, guided setup architecture, and cross-agent conversation optimization.  
This enables completion of the “Get Clarification” rebuild and schema mapping required for full guided setup recovery.

### 📌 November 8, 2025 – Phase 1 Vertical Slice Kickoff
Decision: Start with the Guided Setup → Clarification → Supabase persistence flow (system spine).
Rationale: Validates end-to-end path touching Frontend, Backend, Supabase, and Prompt Engineering. Enables later voice, workflows, and fine-tune to attach cleanly.
Next: Prompt Engineer produces schema, JSON template, clarify API contract, and test plan for Backend + Frontend integration.
